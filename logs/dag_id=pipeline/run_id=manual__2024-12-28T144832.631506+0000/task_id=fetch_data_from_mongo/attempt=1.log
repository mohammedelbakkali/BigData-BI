To this end, we present the results of a post-hoc self-assessment to evaluate the trustworthiness of an AI system for predicting a multiregional score conveying the degree of lung compromise in COVID-19 patients, developed and verified by an interdisciplinary team with members from academia, public hospitals, and industry in time of pandemic. The AI system aims to help radiologists to estimate and communicate the severity of damage in a patient\u2019s lung from Chest X-rays. It has been experimentally deployed in the radiology department of the ASST Spedali Civili clinic in Brescia, Italy, since December 2020 during pandemic time. The methodology we have applied for our post-hoc assessment, called Z-Inspection\u00ae, uses sociotechnical scenarios to identify ethical, technical, and domain-specific issues in the use of the AI system in the context of the pandemic.",

        "abstract": "We are witnessing the emergence of an \u201cAI economy and society\u201d where AI technologies and applications are increasingly impacting health care, business, transportation, defense and many aspects of everyday life. Many successes have been reported where AI systems even surpassed the accuracy of human experts. However, AI systems may produce errors, can exhibit bias, may be sensitive to noise in the data, and often lack technical and judicial transparency resulting in reduction in trust and challenges to their adoption. These recent shortcomings and concerns have been documented in both the scientific and general press such as accidents with self-driving cars, biases in healthcare or hiring and face recognition systems for people of color, and seemingly correct decisions later found to be made due to wrong reasons etc. This has resulted in the emergence of many government and regulatory initiatives requiring trustworthy and ethical AI to provide accuracy and robustness, some form of explainability, human control and oversight, elimination of bias, judicial transparency and safety. The challenges in delivery of trustworthy AI systems have motivated intense research on explainable AI systems (XAI). The original aim of XAI is to provide human understandable information of how AI systems make their decisions in order to increase user trust. In this paper we first very briefly summarize current XAI work and then challenge the recent arguments that present \u201caccuracy vs. explainability\u201d as being mutually exclusive and for focusing mainly on deep learning with its limited XAI capabilities. We then present our recommendations for the broad use of XAI in all stages of delivery of high stakes trustworthy AI systems, e.g., development; validation/certification; and trustworthy production and maintenance.",

        "abstract": "Generative AI (GAI) technologies like ChatGPT are permanently changing academic education. Their integration opens up vast opportunities for bespoke learning and better student interaction but also brings about academic honesty issues and the application of real-life educators. This study aims to fill the literature gap regarding the use of multiple GAI tools and their effect on academic outcomes via a comprehensive review. A systematic literature review was performed following PRISMA guidelines to synthesize results on the potential and drawbacks of GAI in educational domains. We included theoretical and empirical papers that used qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods study designs. We have also explored conceptual frameworks and the most creative AI applications with a special emphasis on uniqueness and practicability. Experiences, and Perceptions Concerning To compile the information needed we gathered insights into what students were going through by conducting the survey which contains 200 respondents of undergraduate university students gathering insights into the college students\u2019 experiences and perceptions related to GAI used for educational purposes. At the basic level, GAI comprises areas like personalization, task automation, teacher assistance, and efficiency among others, and respective solutions for the immersion of a learner in learning processes to reform directions. However, it generates plenty of challenges such as the question of assessment integrity, the risk that too much automated grading could overwhelm educational value, and relevantly the veracity of AI-generated content as well as the potential disruption to skills like critical thinking, in addition to data privacy and ethical issues. Student Perception Survey the text also indicates that most students, as per the student perception survey found AI systems useful in academic support. However, they also know the other side of the coin and are very familiar with the technology constra...",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that, during the inference on generative AI models such as transformer, the importance of different weights exhibits substantial context-dependent variations. This naturally manifests a promising potential of adaptively configuring weight quantization to improve the generative AI inference efficiency. Although configurable weight quantization can readily leverage the hardware support of variable-precision arithmetics in modern GPU and AI accelerators, little prior research has studied how one could exploit variable weight quantization to proportionally improve the AI model memory access speed and energy efficiency. Motivated by the rapidly maturing CXL ecosystem, this work develops a CXL-based design solution to fill this gap. The key is to allow CXL memory controllers play an active role in supporting and exploiting runtime configurable weight quantization. Using transformer as a representative generative AI model, we carried out experiments that well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design solution.",

        "abstract": "The network on chip (NoC) used in the AI chip is required to be able to deliver data to multiple destination endpoints simultaneously. The existing solutions, such as hierarchial mesh (HMESH) and FATTREE all modify the connection between routers to achieve multicasting. Although this method can achieve delivering data to multiple destination endpoints at the same time, it significantly increases the number of routers used and, therefore, brings a huge additional area and power consumption overhead. In order to solve this problem, this work designed a customized multicast-enabled tree-based NoC, named mTREE, by modifying the microarchitecture of the router, including the routing calculation unit, credit counter, and switch allocator. When implemented on Arria10 FPGA, mTREE only brings a 1% increase in resource utilization compared with the traditional tree-topology NoC. Compared with two other multicast-enabled NoCs: 1) FATTREE and 2) HMESH, mTREE can reach a\n3.19\u00d7\n\u2013\n3.50\u00d7\nand\n1.67\u00d7\n\u2013\n3.02\u00d7\nreduction in resource utilization, respectively, and a\n4.81\u00d7\n\u2013\n8.01\u00d7\nand\n2.85\u00d7\n\u2013\n3.03\u00d7\nreduction in energy consumption, respectively.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of the existing work on AI for real-time strategy (RTS) games. Specifically, we focus on the work around the game StarCraft, which has emerged in the past few years as the unified test bed for this research. We describe the specific AI challenges posed by RTS games, and overview the solutions that have been explored to address them. Additionally, we also present a summary of the results of the recent StarCraft AI competitions, describing the architectures used by the participants. Finally, we conclude with a discussion emphasizing which problems in the context of RTS game AI have been solved, and which remain open.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we introduce a next-generation annotation tool called NOVA for emotional behaviour analysis, which implements a workflow that interactively incorporates the \u2018human in the loop\u2019. A main aspect of NOVA is the possibility of applying semi-supervised active learning where Machine Learning techniques are used already during the annotation process by giving the possibility to pre-label data automatically. Furthermore, NOVA implements recent eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide users with both, a confidence value of the automatically predicted annotations, as well as visual explanations. We investigate how such techniques can assist non-experts in terms of trust, perceived self-efficacy, cognitive workload as well as creating correct mental models about the system by conducting a user study with 53 participants. The results show that NOVA can easily be used by non-experts and lead to a high computer self-efficacy. Furthermore, the results indicate that XAI visualisations help users to create more correct mental models about the machine learning system compared to the baseline condition. Nevertheless, we suggest that explanations in the field of AI have to be more focused on user-needs as well as on the classification task and the model they want to explain.",

        "abstract": "Traditional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image sea-land segmentation algorithms overlook the ship distribution priori-information provided by the automatic identification system (AIS) data, resulting in poor segmentation performance in complex environments such as ports, marine wetlands, beaches, and other sea-land boundaries. To address the above issues, this article comprehensively uses dual-polarization (VV and VH) SAR images and AIS data as the data source, and it specifically proposes a novel pyramid vision transformer (PVT) assisted by the long-time AIS data (AIS-PVT) for sea-land segmentation. AIS-PVT is the first attempt to integrate the ship distribution density priori-information, provided by the long-time AIS data, into the PVT network, thus the multiscale features of the sea and land can be better distinguished. In the decoding stage, we design a feature filter module (FFM). It aggregates features separately along two spatial directions from the skip connections, enhancing the representation of objects of interest while reducing the influence of redundant information. Furthermore, we develop a boundary-pixel-aware function to steer the model training process, allowing AIS-PVT to concentrate more on the neighborhood information of boundary pixels. Importantly, the AIS-PVT method captures global multiscale information and enhances the model\u2019s data fusion capability. The conclusive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in sea-land segmentation tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.",

        "abstract": "Online gaming is a multibillion dollar industry that entertains a large, global population. Empowering online games with AI has made a great success, however, ignores the explainability of black-box model makes AI less responsible and hinders its further development. In this article, we introduce and discuss the audience and the concept of XAI (eXplainable AI) in online games. We propose a GXAI workflow, which combines the strong expressiveness of multiview data sources and the clear transparency of multiview black-box models. We present four specific classifiers and explainers in the character portrait view, the behavior sequence view, the client image view, and the social graph view. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets for game cheating detection and player churn prediction show the accuracy of classification and the rationality of explanation. We also discover and present numerous interesting and valuable findings from the individual, local, and global explanations. We implement and deploy three practical applications, including evidence and reason generation, model debugging and testing, and model compression and comparison in NetEase Games and have received quite positive reviews from user studies. More future work is in progress since this is the first work that introduces XAI in online games.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel dataset to help researchers evaluate their computer vision and audio models for accuracy across a diverse set of age, genders, apparent skin tones and ambient lighting conditions. Our dataset is composed of 3,011 subjects and contains over 45,000 videos, with an average of 15 videos per person. The videos were recorded in multiple U.S. states with a diverse set of adults in various age, gender and apparent skin tone groups. A key feature is that each subject agreed to participate for their likenesses to be used. Additionally, our age and gender annotations are provided by the subjects themselves. A group of trained annotators labeled the subjects\u2019 apparent skin tone using the Fitzpatrick skin type scale. Moreover, annotations for videos recorded in low ambient lighting are also provided. As an application to measure robustness of predictions across certain attributes, we provide a comprehensive study on the top five winners of the DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC). Experimental evaluation shows that the winning models are less performant on some specific groups of people, such as subjects with darker skin tones and thus may not generalize to all people. In addition, we also evaluate the state-of-the-art apparent age and gender classification methods. Our experiments provides a thorough analysis on these models in terms of fair treatment of people from various backgrounds.",

        "abstract": "Personas have successfully supported the development of classical user interfaces for more than two decades by mapping users\u2019 mental models to specific contexts. The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications makes it necessary to create new approaches for future human-AI interfaces. Human-AI interfaces differ from classical human-computer interfaces in many ways, such as gaining some degree of human-like cognitive, self-executing, and self-adaptive capabilities and autonomy, and generating unexpected outputs that require non-deterministic interactions. Moreover, the most successful AI approaches are so-called \u201cblack box\u201d systems, where the technology and the machine learning process are opaque to the user and the AI output is far not intuitive. This work shows how the personas method can be adapted to support the development of human-centered AI applications, and we demonstrate this on the example of a medical context. This work is - to our knowledge - the first to provide personas for AI using an openly available Personas for AI toolbox . The toolbox contains guidelines and material supporting persona development for AI as well as templates and pictures for persona visualisation. It is ready to use and freely available to the international research and development community. Additionally, an example from medical AI is provided as a best practice use case. This work is intended to help foster the development of novel human-AI interfaces that will be urgently needed in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Game artificial intelligence (AI) competitions are important to foster research and development on Game AI and AI in general. These competitions supply different challenging problems that can be translated into other contexts, virtual or real. They provide frameworks and tools to facilitate the research on their core topics and provide means for comparing and sharing results. A competition is also a way to motivate new researchers to study these challenges. In this article, we present the Geometry Friends game AI competition. Geometry Friends is a two-player cooperative physics-based puzzle platformer computer game. The concept of the game is simple, though its solving has proven to be difficult. While the main and apparent focus of the game is cooperation, it also relies on other AI-related problems such as planning, plan execution, and motion control, all connected to situational awareness. All of these must be solved in real-time. In this article, we discuss the competition and the challenges it brings, and present an overview of the current solutions.",

        "abstract": "Contributions: To address the interpretability issues in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered classroom discourse models, we employ explainable AI methods to unpack classroom discourse analysis from deep learning-based models and evaluate the effects of model explanations on STEM teachers. Background: Deep learning techniques have been used to automatically analyze classroom dialogue to provide feedback for teachers. However, these complex models operate as black boxes, lacking clear explanations of the analysis, which may lead teachers, particularly those lacking AI knowledge, to distrust the models and hinder their teaching practice. Therefore, it is crucial to address the interpretability issue in AI-powered classroom discourse models. Research Questions: How to explain deep learning-based classroom discourse models using explainable AI methods? What is the effect of these explanations on teachers\u2019 trust in and technology acceptance of the models? How do teachers perceive the explanations of deep learning-based classroom discourse models? Method: Two explainable AI methods were employed to interpret deep learning-based models that analyzed teacher and student talk moves. A pilot study was conducted, involving seven STEM teachers interested in learning talk moves and receiving classroom discourse analysis. The study assessed changes in teachers\u2019 trust and technology acceptance before and after receiving model explanations. Teachers\u2019 perceptions of the model explanations were investigated. Findings: The AI-powered classroom discourse models were effectively explained using explainable AI methods. The model explanations enhanced teachers\u2019 trust and technology acceptance of the classroom discourse models. The seven STEM teachers expressed satisfaction with the explanations and provided their perception of model explanations.",

        "abstract": "There has been a trend among various stakeholders for AI governance, such as the government, industry, and academia, that advocates for a shift from traditional ethics approach to more recent policy-oriented approach. This paper starts by briefly introducing the motivation for such a change. To further help AI ethics researchers ground their discussion about how to operationalize abstract AI ethics into actionable policy, it introduces existing literature about AI policy development efforts with ethics focus. We also discuss the implications of the policy approach to normative AI governance for training the next generation of AI professionals. More specifically, this paper introduces two approaches that AI educators can employ to encourage their students to participate in policy discussions and practical exercises in AI-related courses. The insights derived from this paper hold particular significance for AI professionals, educators, and policymakers aiming to translate general AI ethics principles into operationalizable action items with broader policy implications in the design of AI systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper delineates the contemporary landscape, challenges, and prospective developments in human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) within the ambit of smart farming, a pivotal element of the emergent Agriculture 5.0, supplanting Agriculture 4.0. Analogous to Industry 4.0, agriculture has witnessed a trend towards comprehensive automation, often marginalizing human involvement. However, this approach has encountered limitations in agricultural contexts for various reasons. While AI\u2019s capacity to assume human tasks is acknowledged, the inclusion of human expertise and experiential knowledge (human-in-the-loop) often proves indispensable, corroborated by the Moravec\u2019s Paradox: tasks simple for humans are complex for AI. Furthermore, social, ethical, and legal imperatives necessitate human oversight of AI, a stance strongly reflected in the European Union\u2019s regulatory framework. Consequently, this paper explores the advancements in human-centred AI focusing on their application in agricultural processes. These technological strides aim to enhance crop yields, minimize labor and resource wastage, and optimize the farm-to-consumer supply chain. The potential of AI to augment human decision-making, thereby fostering a sustainable, efficient, and resilient agri-food sector, is a focal point of this discussion - motivated by the current worldwide extreme weather events. Finally, a framework for Agriculture 5.0 is presented, which balances technological prowess with the needs, capabilities, and contexts of human stakeholders. Such an approach, emphasizing accessible, intuitive AI systems that meaningfully complement human activities, is crucial for the successful realization of future Agriculture 5.0.",

        "abstract": "The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) systems inspires new research directions on developing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for detecting anomalies in these IoT systems. One important goal in this context is to accurately detect and anticipate anomalies (or failures) in IoT devices and identify main characteristics for such anomalies to reduce maintenance cost and minimize downtime. In this paper, we propose an explainable AI (XAI) framework for enhancing anomaly detection in IoT systems. Our framework has two main components. First, we propose AI-based anomaly detection of IoT systems where we adapt two classes of AI methods (single AI methods, and ensemble methods) for anomaly detection in smart IoT systems. Such anomaly detection aims at detecting anomaly data (from deployed sensors or network traffic between IoT devices). Second, we conduct feature importance analysis to identify the main features that can help AI models identify anomalies in IoT systems. For this feature analysis, we use seven different XAI methods for extracting important features for different AI methods and different attack types. We test our XAI framework for anomaly detection through two real-world IoT datasets. The first dataset is collected from IoT-based manufacturing sensors and the second dataset is collected from IoT botnet attacks. For the IoT-based manufacturing dataset, we detect the level of defect for data from IoT sensors. For the IoT botnet attack dataset, we detect different attack classes from different kinds of botnet attacks on the IoT network. For both datasets, we provide extensive feature importance analysis using different XAI methods for our different AI models to extract the top features. We release our codes for the community to access it for anomaly detection and feature analysis for IoT systems and to build on it with new datasets and models. Taken together, we show that accurate anomaly detection can be achieved along with understanding top ...",

        "abstract": "The increasing demand for data-intensive analytics, driven by the rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), has led to the proposal of various AI accelerators. However, as AI-based solutions are being applied to applications that require high accuracy and reliability, ensuring the dependability of these solutions has become a critical issue. In this brief, we present an area-efficient systolic array redundancy architecture for reliable AI accelerator. In the proposed architecture, computations assigned to faulty multiply-accumulate (MAC) units are bypassed using dedicated routes. Subsequently, the same computations are executed in shiftable redundant MACs or selectable redundant MACs. This ensures the correct completion of calculations all without performance reduction. Moreover, the reassignment of computations can be efficiently managed through a simple scheduling algorithm. As a result, the proposed architecture achieves a high repair rate through the redundant MACs and effective computation reassignment. Despite these capabilities, the proposed architecture incurs only a small area overhead.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) is an automated method for generating, manipulating, and modifying valuable and diverse data using AI algorithms creatively. This survey paper focuses on the deployment of AIGC applications, e.g., ChatGPT and Dall-E, at mobile edge networks, namely mobile AIGC networks, that provide personalized and customized AIGC services in real time while maintaining user privacy. We begin by introducing the background and fundamentals of generative models and the lifecycle of AIGC services at mobile AIGC networks, which includes data collection, training, fine-tuning, inference, and product management. We then discuss the collaborative cloud-edge-mobile infrastructure and technologies required to support AIGC services and enable users to access AIGC at mobile edge networks. Furthermore, we explore AIGC-driven creative applications and use cases for mobile AIGC networks. Additionally, we discuss the implementation, security, and privacy challenges of deploying mobile AIGC networks. Finally, we highlight some future research directions and open issues for the full realization of mobile AIGC networks.",

        "abstract": "The swift progress of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools offers remarkable potential for revolutionizing educational methods and enhancing social sustainability. Despite its potential, understanding the factors driving its adoption and how that affects social sustainability remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by integrating AI attributes (\u201cperceived anthropomorphism,\u201d \u201cperceived intelligence,\u201d and \u201cperceived animacy\u201d) with the theory of planned behavior and the technology-environmental, economic, and social sustainability theory (T-EESST) to develop a theoretical research model. Utilizing a hybrid structural equation modeling and artificial neural network approach, we analyzed data collected from 1048 university students to evaluate the developed model. Our findings revealed that while perceived behavioral control has an insignificant impact on generative AI use, attitudes emerge as the most critical factor, further reinforced by the significant role of subjective norms. Perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived animacy were also found to influence students\u2019 attitudes significantly. More importantly, the findings supported the role of generative AI in positively affecting social sustainability, aligning with the principles of T-EESST. This study's significance lies in its holistic examination of the interplay between technological attributes, motivational aspects, and sustainability outcomes, offering valuable insights for various stakeholders.",

        "abstract": "Video games are one of the richest and most popular forms of human-computer interaction and, hence, their role is critical for our understanding of human behaviour and affect at a large scale. As artificial intelligence (AI) tools are gradually adopted by the game industry a series of ethical concerns arise. Such concerns, however, have so far not been extensively discussed in a video game context. Motivated by the lack of a comprehensive review on the ethics of AI as applied to games, we survey the current state of the art in this area and discuss ethical considerations of these systems from the holistic perspective of the affective loop . Through the components of this loop, we study the ethical challenges that AI faces in video game development. Elicitation highlights the ethical boundaries of artificially induced emotions; sensing showcases the trade-off between privacy and safe gaming spaces; and detection , as utilised during in-game adaptation , poses challenges to transparency and ownership. This paper calls for an open dialogue and action for the games of today and the virtual spaces of the future. By setting an appropriate framework we aim to protect users and to guide developers towards safer and better experiences for their customers.",

        "abstract": "The exponential growth of intrusions on networked systems inspires new research directions on developing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for intrusion detection systems (IDS). In particular, the need to understand and explain these AI models to security analysts (managing these IDS to safeguard their networks) motivates the usage of explainable AI (XAI) methods in real-world IDS. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework to evaluate black-box XAI methods for network IDS. We evaluate both global and local scopes for these black-box XAI methods for network intrusion detection. We analyze six different evaluation metrics for two popular black-box XAI techniques, namely SHAP and LIME. These metrics are descriptive accuracy, sparsity, stability, efficiency, robustness, and completeness. They cover main metrics from network security and AI domains. We evaluate our XAI evaluation framework using three popular network intrusion datasets and seven AI methods with different characteristics. We release our codes for the network security community to access it as a baseline XAI framework for network IDS. Our framework shows the limitations and strengths of current black-box XAI methods when applied to network IDS.",

        "abstract": "Semiconductor manufacturing, a critical driver of modern technology, involves intricate processes for fabricating integrated circuits on materials like silicon. This industry\u2019s pivotal role spans various applications, from smartphones to computers, emphasizing the importance of fault detection to ensure the reliability and cost-efficiency of electronic devices. Fault detection within this sector entails collaboration among multiple stakeholders, including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs), wafer foundries, and software providers. A common challenge is the reluctance to share sensitive design data centrally, which is essential for building traditional machine learning models. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative fault detection model that leverages Federated Learning (FL) and Explainable AI (XAI). FL\u2019s decentralized approach enhances model learning across multiple nodes without requiring the pooling of sensitive data, thus preserving data privacy. Concurrently, XAI ensures that the developed models maintain transparency and trustworthiness, even when trained on distributed datasets. This FL-based fault detection model permits stakeholders to train ML models on node-specific data without centralizing sensitive information. It accommodates heterogeneous and asynchronously-stored data, diverse machine learning models, and nodes with varying capacities and data volumes. By addressing the opacity of deep learning models, FL and XAI unveil their predictive behaviors in identifying semiconductor faults. Empirical results, obtained using a public dataset, demonstrate a significant improvement in defect identification precision, achieving an exceptional test accuracy of 98.78%. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed approach to transform fault detection in semiconductor manufacturing, thereby enhancing the reliability and efficiency of the production process.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision complications and partially sighted which pose considerable diagnostic difficulties because of its diverse and varying symptoms. Some of them include the fact that the disease displays a non-uniform pattern, where patients present different symptoms; the requirement of highly qualified specialists to interpret the images of the fundus; the risk of errors in the interpretation of images or their inconsistency; and the absence of clear morphological signs often makes early diagnosis unlikely. Traditional diagnosis mostly rely on the expert interpretation of retinal images, which can lead to bias and inaccuracy; highlighting the need for improved diagnostic methods. Although traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods enhance the diagnostic capabilities remarkably, their black box nature and information opacity restrict healthcare providers to comprehend the reasoning framework of the AI to build trust and optimize its usage in practice. Explainable AI (XAI) is an emerging approach that addresses the black-box problem by improving the interpretability of models, which allows users to understand the logic behind certain decisions. This research proposed a diagnosis model for detecting diabetic retinopathy using XAI approaches that increases the interpretability of the models to help clinicians understand the reasons behind the decisions. The proposed model is used to enhance diagnostic accuracy, offer comprehensible, and concise insights regarding the diagnostics. The convergence history plots of the proposed model validate the learning process to achieve 94% better diagnostic accuracy than traditional methods while improving interpretability and applicability in healthcare settings, indicating improvement in accuracy and loss reduction.",

        "abstract": "Fields such as machine learning and artificial intelligence are proven business enablers, we have several use cases in the field of technology from basic implementations such as automated scanners, and weak forms such as Alexa and Siri that have paved the way for further development. Search for more avenues of investment in this field continues till date. It\u2019s also evident that researchers and organizations have barely scratched the surface in terms of exploring and using AI (Artificial intelligence) as a technology. Theoretical forms of AI have not yet been implemented. This paper aims to provide some context around the various forms of AI currently used and can be explored in the near future. It\u2019s important to be mindful that, with the use of any technology, even AI, there are challenges, regulations, and security risks that tag along. Firms need to pay close attention to the macro factors that could impact the adoption and AI in their respective businesses. This study aims to provide a brief overview of the aforementioned road blocks that could impact AI adoption, however, there are some solution strategies or approaches that could help firms along the way to overcome those road blocks. These strategies might take time to build and take effect but they will be beneficial in the long run and thus help with not only sustainable implementation, but also complete and successful adoption of AI as a technology enabler.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in AI technologies are dramatically changing the world and impacting our daily life. However, human users still essentially need to cooperate with AI systems to complete tasks as such technologies are never perfect. For optimal performance and safety in human-AI cooperation, human users must appropriately adjust their level of trust to the actual reliability of AI systems. Poorly calibrated trust can be a major cause of serious issues with safety and efficiency. Previous works on trust calibration have emphasized the importance of system transparency for avoiding trust miscalibration. Measuring and influencing trust are still challenging issues; consequently, not many studies have focused on how to detect improper trust calibration nor how to mitigate it. We approach these research challenges with a behavior-based approach to capture the status of calibration. A framework of adaptive trust calibration is proposed, including a formal definition of improper trust calibration called \u201ca trust equation\u201d. It involves cognitive cues called \u201ctrust calibration cues (TCCs)\u201d and a conceptual entity called \u201ctrust calibration AI\u201d (TCAI), which supervises the status of trust calibration. We conducted empirical evaluations using a simulated drone environment with two types of cooperative tasks: a visual search task and a real-time navigation task. We designed trust changing scenarios and evaluated our framework. The results demonstrated that adaptively presenting a TCC could promote trust calibration more effectively than a traditional system transparency approach.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in various fields, with rapid expansion of the scope of AI-human interactions. However, most AI technologies continue to exhibit black-box characteristics, i.e., their decisions and actions are not explainable, degrading user experience (UX). Recently, research on explainable AI (XAI), focusing on both AI performance and UX, has garnered significant attention. However, development of generalizable UX evaluation tools for AI and improvement of AI UX have not been investigated adequately. In this study, a UX evaluation tool is developed for AI based on a systematic literature review and verified using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Subsequently, based on identified AI UX factors, UX of an AI defense system is upgraded. Based on user evaluation, there were significant improvements in eight factors (satisfaction, safety, controllability, trust, causality, efficiency, accountability, and explainability) with the exception of fairness. The proposed evaluation tool is expected to serve as a cornerstone for future evaluation of AI UX advancement.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made tremendous progress in anomaly detection. However, AI models work as a black-box, making it challenging to provide reasoning behind their judgments in a Log Anomaly Detection (LAD). To the rescue, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) improves system log analysis. It follows a white-box model for transparency, understandability, trustworthiness, and dependability of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) Models. In addition, Shapely Additive Explanation (SHAP), added to system dynamics, makes informed judgments and adoptable proactive methods to optimize system functionality and reliability. Therefore, this paper proposed the Shapely eXplainable Anomaly Detection (SXAD) framework to identify different events (features) that impact the models\u2019 interpretability, trustworthiness, and explainability. The framework utilizes the Kernel SHAP approach, which is based on Shapley values principle, providing an innovative approach to event selection and identifying specific events causing abnormal behavior. This study addresses the LAD by transforming it from a black-box model into a white-box one, leveraging XAI to make it transparent, interpretable, explainable, and dependable. It utilizes benchmark data from the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), organized using a Drain parser, and employs several ML models, such as Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB). These models achieve impressive accuracy rates of 99.99%, 99.85%, and 99.99%, respectively. Our contribution are novel because no earlier work has been done in the area of Log Anomaly Detection (LAD) with integration of XAI-SHAP.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators that support AI services consist of multiple identical cores for parallel computation to accelerate artificial neural networks. Recently, systolic array-based architectures for low-power AI accelerators have been studied to support battery-operated edge devices and reduce power consumption. In this brief, a zero-overhead method is proposed for efficient testing of systolic array-based low-power AI accelerators. By using the structural characteristics of the systolic array and a reset operation, the proposed method can test multiple identical cores based on the systolic array without any additional hardware. The proposed method is divided into MAC and comparator test methods to use the structural characteristics of systolic arrays for low-power AI accelerators. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 100% test coverage without any additional hardware and has reasonable test times compared to previous methods.",

        "abstract": "Traffic accidents continue to be a significant cause of fatalities, injuries, and considerable disruptions on our highways. Understanding the underlying factors behind these incidents is crucial for improving safety on road networks. While recent studies have highlighted the usefulness of predictive modeling in uncovering factors leading to accidents, there remains a gap in explaining the inner workings of complex machine learning and deep learning models and how various features influence accident prediction. This lack of transparency may lead to these models being perceived as black boxes, potentially undermining trust in their findings among stakeholders. The primary aim of this research is to develop predictive models using diverse transfer learning techniques and shed light on the most influential factors using Shapley values. In predicting injury severity in accidents, we employ Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Residual Networks (ResNET), EfficientNetB4, InceptionV3, Extreme Inception (Xception), Visual Geometry Group (VGG19), AlexNet, and MobileNet. Among these models, MobileNet emerges with the highest accuracy at 0.9817. Furthermore, by comprehending how different features impact accident prediction models, researchers can deepen their understanding of the factors contributing to accidents and devise more effective interventions for their prevention.",

        "abstract": "The position and orientation of the human neck need to be measured, analyzed, and monitored during head impacts to provide preventive healthcare measures. The proposed research explores the role of explainable Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in predicting the direction of the neck by analysing the muscle forces with appropriate explanations to support any clinical system for correct decision-making. The experimental data includes mild head impacts that were replicated with median American football simulating flexion and lateral movements and was performed on ten subjects including five male and five females. OpenSim software system is used for biomechanical modeling, simulation, and analysis and to visualize the direction of the neck. Different machine learning models including a sequential neural network model were built on the labelled tendon force muscle data. The XGB classifier achieved the best performance in predicting the neck direction with an accuracy of 98 percent. The proposed research work\u2019s accuracy is promising when compared to existing works. Explainable Artificial Intelligence integration deduces the predictions of machine learning models adding meaningful interpretations to the achieved results.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a framework that integrates fairness and transparency into advanced machine learning models, specifically LightGBM and XGBoost, applied to loan approval and house price prediction datasets. The key contribution is using fairness-focused techniques, such as Calibrated Equalized Odds and Intersectional Fairness, which are not widely studied in financial and real estate contexts. To improve model transparency, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is utilized along with a novel fairness-based interpretability method to measure both model fairness and the importance of individual features. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that LightGBM delivers high accuracy while balancing fairness and performance effectively. The broader relevance of this work is discussed in the context of governance and regulatory requirements, highlighting the importance of responsible practices in high-stakes financial decision-making processes. This research highlights the importance of fairness and transparency in real-world applications, promoting equity, trust, and adherence to evolving legal standards, and provides practical insights for data scientists, machine learning researchers, and professionals in the real estate and financial sectors.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning is an emerging privacy-preserving AI technique where clients (i.e., organizations or devices) train models locally and formulate a global model based on the local model updates without transferring local data externally. However, federated learning systems struggle to achieve trustworthiness and embody responsible AI principles. In particular, federated learning systems face accountability and fairness challenges due to multistakeholder involvement and heterogeneity in client data distribution. To enhance the accountability and fairness of federated learning systems, we present a blockchain-based trustworthy federated learning architecture. We first design a smart contract-based data-model provenance registry to enable accountability. Additionally, we propose a weighted fair data sampler algorithm to enhance fairness in training data. We evaluate the proposed approach using a COVID-19 X-ray detection use case. The evaluation results show that the approach is feasible to enable accountability and improve fairness. The proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the default federated learning setting in terms of the model\u2019s generalization and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "In our modern era, it has become essential for citizens to possess artificial intelligence (AI) literacy to navigate an AI-driven society. However, there is a current deficiency in students\u2019 AI literacy. In response to this challenge, this article introduced the AI STEM Project Design Framework (AI-STEM PDF) designed specifically for teaching AI in middle schools. The framework, created in adherence to Activity Theory and the principles of STEM environment design, consists of five layers: subject-object analysis layer, project design layer, learning tool layer, project rules layer, and project goals layer. Following the development of the AI-STEM PDF, AI-STEM projects were devised, and a pre-post experimental design study was conducted with 64 middle school students across two schools. The results revealed significant improvements in students\u2019 AI literacy, thus affirming the value of the AI-STEM framework. Ultimately, the AI-STEM PDF has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of AI courses by providing valuable guidance for their instruction, thereby fostering the development of middle school students\u2019 AI literacy.",

        "abstract": "Losing a loved one through death is known to be one of the most challenging life events. To help the bereaved and their therapists monitor and better understand the factors that contribute to Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), we co-designed and studied a web-based explainable AI screening system named \u201cGrief Inquiries Following Tragedy (GIFT).\u201d We used an initial iteration of the system to collect PGD-related data from 611 participants. Using this data, we developed a model that could be used to screen and explain the different factors contributing to PGD. Our results showed that a Random Forest model using Bereavement risk and outcome features performed best in detecting PGD (AUC=0.772), with features such as a negative intepretation of grief and the ability to integrate stressful life events contributing strongly to the model. Afterwards, five grief experts were asked to provide feedback on a mock-up of the results generated by the GIFT model, and discuss the potential value of the explanatory AI model in real-world PGD care. Overall, the grief experts were generally receptive towards using such a tool in a clinical setting and acknowledged the benefit of offering a personalized result to the users based on the explainable AI model. Our results also showed that, in addition to the explainability of the model, the grief experts also preferred a more \u201cempathetic\u201d and \u201cactionable\u201d AI system, especially, when designing for patient end-users.",

To this end, we present the results of a post-hoc self-assessment to evaluate the trustworthiness of an AI system for predicting a multiregional score conveying the degree of lung compromise in COVID-19 patients, developed and verified by an interdisciplinary team with members from academia, public hospitals, and industry in time of pandemic. The AI system aims to help radiologists to estimate and communicate the severity of damage in a patient’s lung from Chest X-rays. It has been experimentally deployed in the radiology department of the ASST Spedali Civili clinic in Brescia, Italy, since December 2020 during pandemic time. The methodology we have applied for our post-hoc assessment, called Z-Inspection®, uses sociotechnical scenarios to identify ethical, technical, and domain-specific issues in the use of the AI system in the context of the pandemic.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Himanshi Allahabadi', 'affiliation': 'Enterprise Intelligence Department', 'publications_count': '1', 'citations_count': '16'}, {'name': 'Julia Amann', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology', 'publications_count': '1', 'citations_count': '16'}]}, {'_id': '67681fc4027fa81b9455e661', 'Title': 'It is Not “Accuracy vs. Explainability”—We Need Both for Trustworthy AI Systems', 'DOI': '10.1109/TTS.2023.3239921', 'Authors': ['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295815100', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37295815100'], 'Publication Date': 'Date of Publication: 30 January 2023', 'ISSN': {'Print ISSN': 'Non disponible', 'Electronic ISSN': '2637-6415', 'CD': 'Non disponible'}, 'Link': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10029927/', 'Quartils': 'Journal pas indexé Scopus', 'journal_main': 'Published in: IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society ( Volume: 4, Issue: 1, March 2023)', 'abstract': 'We are witnessing the emergence of an “AI economy and society” where AI technologies and applications are increasingly impacting health care, business, transportation, defense and many aspects of everyday life. Many successes have been reported where AI systems even surpassed the accuracy of human experts. However, AI systems may produce errors, can exhibit bias, may be sensitive to noise in the data, and often lack technical and judicial transparency resulting in reduction in trust and challenges to their adoption. These recent shortcomings and concerns have been documented in both the scientific and general press such as accidents with self-driving cars, biases in healthcare or hiring and face recognition systems for people of color, and seemingly correct decisions later found to be made due to wrong reasons etc. This has resulted in the emergence of many government and regulatory initiatives requiring trustworthy and ethical AI to provide accuracy and robustness, some form of explainability, human control and oversight, elimination of bias, judicial transparency and safety. The challenges in delivery of trustworthy AI systems have motivated intense research on explainable AI systems (XAI). The original aim of XAI is to provide human understandable information of how AI systems make their decisions in order to increase user trust. In this paper we first very briefly summarize current XAI work and then challenge the recent arguments that present “accuracy vs. explainability” as being mutually exclusive and for focusing mainly on deep learning with its limited XAI capabilities. We then present our recommendations for the broad use of XAI in all stages of delivery of high stakes trustworthy AI systems, e.g., development; validation/certification; and trustworthy production and maintenance.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Dragutin Petkovic', 'affiliation': 'Computer Science Department', 'publications_count': '32', 'citations_count': '2,652'}, {'name': 'Dragutin Petkovic',

technologies like ChatGPT are permanently changing academic education. Their integration opens up vast opportunities for bespoke learning and better student interaction but also brings about academic honesty issues and the application of real-life educators. This study aims to fill the literature gap regarding the use of multiple GAI tools and their effect on academic outcomes via a comprehensive review. A systematic literature review was performed following PRISMA guidelines to synthesize results on the potential and drawbacks of GAI in educational domains. We included theoretical and empirical papers that used qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods study designs. We have also explored conceptual frameworks and the most creative AI applications with a special emphasis on uniqueness and practicability. Experiences, and Perceptions Concerning To compile the information needed we gathered insights into what students were going through by conducting the survey which contains 200 respondents of undergraduate university students gathering insights into the college students’ experiences and perceptions related to GAI used for educational purposes. At the basic level, GAI comprises areas like personalization, task automation, teacher assistance, and efficiency among others, and respective solutions for the immersion of a learner in learning processes to reform directions. However, it generates plenty of challenges such as the question of assessment integrity, the risk that too much automated grading could overwhelm educational value, and relevantly the veracity of AI-generated content as well as the potential disruption to skills like critical thinking, in addition to data privacy and ethical issues. Student Perception Survey the text also indicates that most students, as per the student perception survey found AI systems useful in academic support.

Motivated by the rapidly maturing CXL ecosystem, this work develops a CXL-based design solution to fill this gap.

Although this method can achieve delivering data to multiple destination endpoints at the same time, it significantly increases the number of routers used and, therefore, brings a huge additional area and power consumption overhead. In order to solve this problem, this work designed a customized multicast-enabled tree-based NoC, named mTREE, by modifying the microarchitecture of the router, including the routing calculation unit, credit counter, and switch allocator. When implemented on Arria10 FPGA, mTREE only brings a 1% increase in resource utilization compared with the traditional tree-topology NoC. Compared with two other multicast-enabled NoCs: 1) FATTREE and 2) HMESH, mTREE can reach a\n3.19×\n–\n3.50×\nand\n1.67×\n–\n3.02×\nreduction in resource utilization, respectively, and

next-generation annotation tool called NOVA for emotional behaviour analysis, which implements a workflow that interactively incorporates the ‘human in the loop’. A main aspect of NOVA is the possibility of applying semi-supervised active learning where Machine Learning techniques are used already during the annotation process by giving the possibility to pre-label data automatically. Furthermore, NOVA implements recent eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide users with both, a confidence value of the automatically predicted annotations, as well as visual explanations. We investigate how such techniques can assist non-experts in terms of trust, perceived self-efficacy, cognitive workload as well as creating correct mental models about the system by conducting a user study with 53 participants. The results show that NOVA can easily be used by non-experts and lead to a high computer self-efficacy. Furthermore, the results indicate that XAI visualisations help users to create more correct mental models about the machine learning system compared to the baseline condition. Nevertheless, we suggest that explanations in the field of AI have to be more focused on user-needs as well as on the classification task and the model they want to explain.', 'authors_list':

Geoscience and Remote Sensing ( Volume: 62)', 'abstract': 'Traditional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image sea-land segmentation algorithms overlook the ship distribution priori-information provided by the automatic identification system (AIS) data, resulting in poor segmentation performance in complex environments such as ports, marine wetlands, beaches, and other sea-land boundaries. To address the above issues, this article comprehensively uses dual-polarization (VV and VH) SAR images and AIS data as the data source, and it specifically proposes a novel pyramid vision transformer (PVT) assisted by the long-time AIS data (AIS-PVT) for sea-land segmentation. AIS-PVT is the first attempt to integrate the ship distribution density priori-information, provided by the long-time AIS data, into the PVT network, thus the multiscale features of the sea and land can be better distinguished. In the decoding stage, we design a feature filter module (FFM). It aggregates features separately along two spatial directions from the skip connections, enhancing the representation of objects of interest while reducing the influence of redundant information. Furthermore, we develop a boundary-pixel-aware function to steer the model training process, allowing AIS-PVT to concentrate more on the neighborhood information of boundary pixels. Importantly, the AIS-PVT method captures global multiscale information and enhances the model’s data fusion capability. The conclusive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in sea-land segmentation tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.', 'authors_list':

In this article, we introduce and discuss the audience and the concept of XAI (eXplainable AI) in online games. We propose a GXAI workflow, which combines the strong expressiveness of multiview data sources and the clear transparency of multiview black-box models. We present four specific classifiers and explainers in the character portrait view, the behavior sequence view, the client image view, and the social graph view. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets for game cheating detection and player churn prediction show the accuracy of classification and the rationality of explanation. We also discover and present numerous interesting and valuable findings from the individual, local, and global explanations. We implement and deploy three practical applications, including evidence and reason generation, model debugging and testing, and model compression and comparison in NetEase Games and have received quite positive reviews from user studies.

Our dataset is composed of 3,011 subjects and contains over 45,000 videos, with an average of 15 videos per person. The videos were recorded in multiple U.S. states with a diverse set of adults in various age, gender and apparent skin tone groups. A key feature is that each subject agreed to participate for their likenesses to be used. Additionally, our age and gender annotations are provided by the subjects themselves. A group of trained annotators labeled the subjects’ apparent skin tone using the Fitzpatrick skin type scale. Moreover, annotations for videos recorded in low ambient lighting are also provided. As an application to measure robustness of predictions across certain attributes, we provide a comprehensive study on the top five winners of the DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC). Experimental evaluation shows that the winning models are less performant on some specific groups of people, such as subjects with darker skin tones and thus may not generalize to all people. In addition, we also evaluate the state-of-the-art apparent age and gender classification methods. Our experiments provides a thorough analysis on these models in terms of fair treatment of people from various backgrounds.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Caner Hazirbas', 'affiliation': 'Meta AI',

users’ mental models to specific contexts. The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications makes it necessary to create new approaches for future human-AI interfaces. Human-AI interfaces differ from classical human-computer interfaces in many ways, such as gaining some degree of human-like cognitive, self-executing, and self-adaptive capabilities and autonomy, and generating unexpected outputs that require non-deterministic interactions. Moreover, the most successful AI approaches are so-called “black box” systems, where the technology and the machine learning process are opaque to the user and the AI output is far not intuitive. This work shows how the personas method can be adapted to support the development of human-centered AI applications, and we demonstrate this on the example of a medical context. This work is - to our knowledge - the first to provide personas for AI using an openly available Personas for AI toolbox . The toolbox contains guidelines and material supporting persona development for AI as well as templates and pictures for persona visualisation. It is ready to use and freely available to the international research and development community. Additionally, an example from medical AI is provided as a best practice use case. This work is intended to help foster the development of novel human-AI interfaces that will be urgently needed in the near future.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Andreas Holzinger', 'affiliation':

A competition is also a way to motivate new researchers to study these challenges. In this article, we present the Geometry Friends game AI competition. Geometry Friends is a two-player cooperative physics-based puzzle platformer computer game. The concept of the game is simple, though its solving has proven to be difficult. While the main and apparent focus of the game is cooperation, it also relies on other AI-related problems such as planning, plan execution, and motion control, all connected to situational awareness. All of these must be solved in real-time.

models, we employ explainable AI methods to unpack classroom discourse analysis from deep learning-based models and evaluate the effects of model explanations on STEM teachers. Background: Deep learning techniques have been used to automatically analyze classroom dialogue to provide feedback for teachers. However, these complex models operate as black boxes, lacking clear explanations of the analysis, which may lead teachers, particularly those lacking AI knowledge, to distrust the models and hinder their teaching practice. Therefore, it is crucial to address the interpretability issue in AI-powered classroom discourse models. Research Questions: How to explain deep learning-based classroom discourse models using explainable AI methods? What is the effect of these explanations on teachers’ trust in and technology acceptance of the models? How do teachers perceive the explanations of deep learning-based classroom discourse models? Method: Two explainable AI methods were employed to interpret deep learning-based models that analyzed teacher and student talk moves. A pilot study was conducted, involving seven STEM teachers interested in learning talk moves and receiving classroom discourse analysis. The study assessed changes in teachers’ trust and technology acceptance before and after receiving model explanations. Teachers’ perceptions of the model explanations were investigated. Findings: The AI-powered classroom discourse models were effectively explained using explainable AI methods. The model explanations enhanced teachers’ trust and technology acceptance of the classroom discourse models. The seven STEM teachers expressed satisfaction with the explanations and provided their perception of model explanations.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Deliang Wang', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Education', 'publications_count': '4', 'citations_count': '8'}, {'name': 'Gaowei Chen', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Education', 'publications_count': '3', 'citations_count': '2'}]}, {'_id': '6768220f027fa81b9455e66d', 'Title': 'Toward a Policy Approach to Normative Artificial Intelligence Governance: Implications for AI Ethics Education', 'DOI': '10.1109/TTS.2024.3430940', 'Authors': ['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089884301', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089656940', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37072281900', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089884301', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089656940', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37072281900'], 'Publication Date': 'Date of Publication: 29 July 2024', 'ISSN': {'Print ISSN': 'Non disponible', 'Electronic ISSN': '2637-6415', 'CD': 'Non disponible'}, 'Link': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614075/', 'Quartils': 'Journal pas indexé Scopus', 'journal_main': 'Published in: IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society ( Volume: 5, Issue: 3, September 2024)', 'abstract': 'There has been a trend among various stakeholders for AI governance, such as the government, industry, and academia, that advocates for a shift from traditional ethics approach to more recent policy-oriented approach. This paper starts by briefly introducing the motivation for such a change. To further help AI ethics researchers ground their discussion about how to operationalize abstract AI ethics into actionable policy, it introduces existing literature about AI policy development efforts with ethics focus. We also discuss the implications of the policy approach to normative AI governance for training the next generation of AI professionals. More specifically, this paper introduces two approaches that AI educators can employ to encourage their students to participate in policy discussions and practical exercises in AI-related courses. The insights derived from this paper hold particular significance for AI professionals, educators, and policymakers aiming to translate general AI ethics principles into operationalizable action items

intelligence (AI) within the ambit of smart farming, a pivotal element of the emergent Agriculture 5.0, supplanting Agriculture 4.0. Analogous to Industry 4.0, agriculture has witnessed a trend towards comprehensive automation, often marginalizing human involvement. However, this approach has encountered limitations in agricultural contexts for various reasons. While AI’s capacity to assume human tasks is acknowledged, the inclusion of human expertise and experiential knowledge (human-in-the-loop) often proves indispensable, corroborated by the Moravec’s Paradox: tasks simple for humans are complex for AI. Furthermore, social, ethical, and legal imperatives necessitate human oversight of AI, a stance strongly reflected in the European Union’s regulatory framework. Consequently, this paper explores the advancements in human-centred AI focusing on their application in agricultural processes. These technological strides aim to enhance crop yields, minimize labor and resource wastage, and optimize the farm-to-consumer supply chain. The potential of AI to augment human decision-making, thereby fostering a sustainable, efficient, and resilient agri-food sector, is a focal point of this discussion - motivated by the current worldwide extreme weather events. Finally, a framework for Agriculture 5.0 is presented, which balances technological prowess with the needs, capabilities, and contexts of human stakeholders. Such an approach, emphasizing accessible, intuitive AI systems that meaningfully complement human activities, is crucial for the successful realization of future Agriculture 5.0.', 'authors_list':

of Internet of Things (IoT) systems inspires new research directions on developing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for detecting anomalies in these IoT systems. One important goal in this context is to accurately detect and anticipate anomalies (or failures) in IoT devices and identify main characteristics for such anomalies to reduce maintenance cost and minimize downtime. In this paper, we propose an explainable AI (XAI) framework for enhancing anomaly detection in IoT systems. Our framework has two main components. First, we propose AI-based anomaly detection of IoT systems where we adapt two classes of AI methods (single AI methods, and ensemble methods) for anomaly detection in smart IoT systems. Such anomaly detection aims at detecting anomaly data (from deployed sensors or network traffic between IoT devices). Second, we conduct feature importance analysis to identify the main features that can help AI models identify anomalies in IoT systems. For this feature analysis, we use seven different XAI methods for extracting important features for different AI methods and different attack types. We test our XAI framework for anomaly detection through two real-world IoT datasets. The first dataset is collected from IoT-based manufacturing sensors and the second dataset is collected from IoT botnet attacks. For the IoT-based manufacturing dataset, we detect the level of defect for data from IoT sensors. For the IoT botnet attack dataset, we detect different attack classes from different kinds of botnet attacks on the IoT network. For both datasets, we provide extensive feature importance analysis using different XAI methods for our different AI models to extract the top features. We release our codes for the community to access it for anomaly detection and feature analysis for IoT systems and to build on it with new datasets and models.

Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems ( Volume: 32, Issue: 10, October 2024)', 'abstract': 'The increasing demand for data-intensive analytics, driven by the rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), has led to the proposal of various AI accelerators. However, as AI-based solutions are being applied to applications that require high accuracy and reliability, ensuring the dependability of these solutions has become a critical issue. In this brief, we present an area-efficient systolic array redundancy architecture for reliable AI accelerator. In the proposed architecture, computations assigned to faulty multiply-accumulate (MAC) units are bypassed using dedicated routes. Subsequently, the same computations are executed in shiftable redundant MACs or selectable redundant MACs. This ensures the correct completion of calculations all without performance reduction. Moreover, the reassignment of computations can be efficiently managed through a simple scheduling algorithm. As a result, the proposed architecture achieves a high repair rate through the redundant MACs and effective computation reassignment. Despite these capabilities, the proposed architecture incurs only a small area overhead.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Hayoung Lee', 'affiliation': 'Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering',

Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) is an automated method for generating, manipulating, and modifying valuable and diverse data using AI algorithms creatively. This survey paper focuses on the deployment of AIGC applications, e.g., ChatGPT and Dall-E, at mobile edge networks, namely mobile AIGC networks, that provide personalized and customized AIGC services in real time while maintaining user privacy. We begin by introducing the background and fundamentals of generative models and the lifecycle of AIGC services at mobile AIGC networks, which includes data collection, training, fine-tuning, inference, and product management. We then discuss the collaborative cloud-edge-mobile infrastructure and technologies required to support AIGC services and enable users to access AIGC at mobile edge networks. Furthermore, we explore AIGC-driven creative applications and use cases for mobile AIGC networks. Additionally, we discuss the implementation, security, and privacy challenges of deploying mobile AIGC networks. Finally, we highlight some future research directions and open issues for the full realization of mobile AIGC networks.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Minrui Xu', 'affiliation': 'College of Computing

generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools offers remarkable potential for revolutionizing educational methods and enhancing social sustainability. Despite its potential, understanding the factors driving its adoption and how that affects social sustainability remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by integrating AI attributes (“perceived anthropomorphism,” “perceived intelligence,” and “perceived animacy”) with the theory of planned behavior and the technology-environmental, economic, and social sustainability theory (T-EESST) to develop a theoretical research model. Utilizing a hybrid structural equation modeling and artificial neural network approach, we analyzed data collected from 1048 university students to evaluate the developed model. Our findings revealed that while perceived behavioral control has an insignificant impact on generative AI use, attitudes emerge as the most critical factor, further reinforced by the significant role of subjective norms. Perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived animacy were also found to influence students’ attitudes significantly. More importantly, the findings supported the role of generative AI in positively affecting social sustainability, aligning with the principles of T-EESST. This study's significance lies in its holistic examination of the interplay between technological attributes, motivational aspects, and sustainability outcomes, offering valuable insights for various stakeholders.", 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Mostafa Al-Emran', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Engineering and IT', 'publications_count': '15', 'citations_count': '578'}, {'name': 'Bassam Abu-Hijleh',

Affective Computing ( Volume: 15, Issue: 1, Jan.-March 2024)', 'abstract': 'Video games are one of the richest and most popular forms of human-computer interaction and, hence, their role is critical for our understanding of human behaviour and affect at a large scale. As artificial intelligence (AI) tools are gradually adopted by the game industry a series of ethical concerns arise. Such concerns, however, have so far not been extensively discussed in a video game context. Motivated by the lack of a comprehensive review on the ethics of AI as applied to games, we survey the current state of the art in this area and discuss ethical considerations of these systems from the holistic perspective of the affective loop . Through the components of this loop, we study the ethical challenges that AI faces in video game development. Elicitation highlights the ethical boundaries of artificially induced emotions; sensing showcases the trade-off between privacy and safe gaming spaces; and detection , as utilised during in-game adaptation , poses challenges to transparency and ownership. This paper calls for an open dialogue and action for the games of today and the virtual spaces of the future. By setting an appropriate framework we aim to protect users and to guide developers towards safer and better experiences for their customers.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'David Melhart',

intelligence (AI) techniques for intrusion detection systems (IDS). In particular, the need to understand and explain these AI models to security analysts (managing these IDS to safeguard their networks) motivates the usage of explainable AI (XAI) methods in real-world IDS. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework to evaluate black-box XAI methods for network IDS. We evaluate both global and local scopes for these black-box XAI methods for network intrusion detection. We analyze six different evaluation metrics for two popular black-box XAI techniques, namely SHAP and LIME. These metrics are descriptive accuracy, sparsity, stability, efficiency, robustness, and completeness. They cover main metrics from network security and AI domains. We evaluate our XAI evaluation framework using three popular network intrusion datasets and seven AI methods with different characteristics. We release our codes for the network security community to access it as a baseline XAI framework for network IDS. Our framework shows the limitations and strengths of current black-box XAI methods when applied to network IDS.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Osvaldo Arreche', 'affiliation': 'Electrical and Computer Engineering Department', 'publications_count': '2', 'citations_count': '8'}, {'name': 'Tanish R.

'abstract': 'Semiconductor manufacturing, a critical driver of modern technology, involves intricate processes for fabricating integrated circuits on materials like silicon. This industry’s pivotal role spans various applications, from smartphones to computers, emphasizing the importance of fault detection to ensure the reliability and cost-efficiency of electronic devices. Fault detection within this sector entails collaboration among multiple stakeholders, including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs), wafer foundries, and software providers. A common challenge is the reluctance to share sensitive design data centrally, which is essential for building traditional machine learning models. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative fault detection model that leverages Federated Learning (FL) and Explainable AI (XAI). FL’s decentralized approach enhances model learning across multiple nodes without requiring the pooling of sensitive data, thus preserving data privacy. Concurrently, XAI ensures that the developed models maintain transparency and trustworthiness, even when trained on distributed datasets. This FL-based fault detection model permits stakeholders to train ML models on node-specific data without centralizing sensitive information. It accommodates heterogeneous and asynchronously-stored data, diverse machine learning models, and nodes with varying capacities and data volumes. By addressing the opacity of deep learning models, FL and XAI unveil their predictive behaviors in identifying semiconductor faults. Empirical results, obtained using a public dataset, demonstrate a significant improvement in defect identification precision, achieving an exceptional test accuracy of 98.78%. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed approach to transform fault detection in semiconductor manufacturing, thereby enhancing the reliability and efficiency of the production

in: IEEE Access ( Volume: 12)', 'abstract': 'Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision complications and partially sighted which pose considerable diagnostic difficulties because of its diverse and varying symptoms. Some of them include the fact that the disease displays a non-uniform pattern, where patients present different symptoms; the requirement of highly qualified specialists to interpret the images of the fundus; the risk of errors in the interpretation of images or their inconsistency; and the absence of clear morphological signs often makes early diagnosis unlikely. Traditional diagnosis mostly rely on the expert interpretation of retinal images, which can lead to bias and inaccuracy; highlighting the need for improved diagnostic methods. Although traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods enhance the diagnostic capabilities remarkably, their black box nature and information opacity restrict healthcare providers to comprehend the reasoning framework of the AI to build trust and optimize its usage in practice. Explainable AI (XAI) is an emerging approach that addresses the black-box problem by improving the interpretability of models, which allows users to understand the logic behind certain decisions. This research proposed a diagnosis model for detecting diabetic retinopathy using XAI approaches that increases the interpretability of the models to help clinicians understand the reasons behind the decisions. The proposed model is used to enhance diagnostic accuracy, offer comprehensible, and concise insights regarding the diagnostics. The convergence history plots of the proposed model validate the learning process to achieve 94% better diagnostic accuracy than traditional methods while improving interpretability and applicability

learning and artificial intelligence are proven business enablers, we have several use cases in the field of technology from basic implementations such as automated scanners, and weak forms such as Alexa and Siri that have paved the way for further development. Search for more avenues of investment in this field continues till date. It’s also evident that researchers and organizations have barely scratched the surface in terms of exploring and using AI (Artificial intelligence) as a technology. Theoretical forms of AI have not yet been implemented. This paper aims to provide some context around the various forms of AI currently used and can be explored in the near future. It’s important to be mindful that, with the use of any technology, even AI, there are challenges, regulations, and security risks that tag along. Firms need to pay close attention to the macro factors that could impact the adoption and AI in their respective businesses. This study aims to provide a brief overview of the aforementioned road blocks that could impact AI adoption, however, there are some solution strategies or approaches that could help firms along the way to overcome those road blocks. These strategies might take time to build and take effect but they will be beneficial in the long run and thus help with not only sustainable implementation, but also complete and successful adoption of AI as a technology enabler.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Pranith Shetty', 'affiliation': 'Cisco Systems Inc.', 'publications_count': '1', 'citations_count': '0'}, {'name': 'Pranith Shetty',

in: IEEE Access ( Volume: 8)', 'abstract': 'Recent advances in AI technologies are dramatically changing the world and impacting our daily life. However, human users still essentially need to cooperate with AI systems to complete tasks as such technologies are never perfect. For optimal performance and safety in human-AI cooperation, human users must appropriately adjust their level of trust to the actual reliability of AI systems. Poorly calibrated trust can be a major cause of serious issues with safety and efficiency. Previous works on trust calibration have emphasized the importance of system transparency for avoiding trust miscalibration. Measuring and influencing trust are still challenging issues; consequently, not many studies have focused on how to detect improper trust calibration nor how to mitigate it. We approach these research challenges with a behavior-based approach to capture the status of calibration. A framework of adaptive trust calibration is proposed, including a formal definition of improper trust calibration called “a trust equation”. It involves cognitive cues called “trust calibration cues (TCCs)” and a conceptual entity called “trust calibration AI” (TCAI), which supervises the status of trust calibration. We conducted empirical evaluations using a simulated drone environment with two types of cooperative tasks: a visual search task and a real-time navigation task. We designed trust changing scenarios and evaluated our framework. The results demonstrated that adaptively presenting a TCC could promote trust calibration more effectively than a traditional system transparency approach.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Kazuo Okamura',

(AI) has been applied in various fields, with rapid expansion of the scope of AI-human interactions. However, most AI technologies continue to exhibit black-box characteristics, i.e., their decisions and actions are not explainable, degrading user experience (UX). Recently, research on explainable AI (XAI), focusing on both AI performance and UX, has garnered significant attention. However, development of generalizable UX evaluation tools for AI and improvement of AI UX have not been investigated adequately. In this study, a UX evaluation tool is developed for AI based on a systematic literature review and verified using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Subsequently, based on identified AI UX factors, UX of an AI defense system is upgraded. Based on user evaluation, there were significant improvements in eight factors (satisfaction, safety, controllability, trust, causality, efficiency, accountability, and explainability) with the exception of fairness. The proposed evaluation tool is expected to serve as a cornerstone for future evaluation of AI UX advancement.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Sunyoung Park', 'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering', 'publications_count': '4', 'citations_count': '6'}, {'name': 'Hyun K.

However, AI models work as a black-box, making it challenging to provide reasoning behind their judgments in a Log Anomaly Detection (LAD). To the rescue, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) improves system log analysis. It follows a white-box model for transparency, understandability, trustworthiness, and dependability of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) Models. In addition, Shapely Additive Explanation (SHAP), added to system dynamics, makes informed judgments and adoptable proactive methods to optimize system functionality and reliability. Therefore, this paper proposed the Shapely eXplainable Anomaly Detection (SXAD) framework to identify different events (features) that impact the models’ interpretability, trustworthiness, and explainability. The framework utilizes the Kernel SHAP approach, which is based on Shapley values principle, providing an innovative approach to event selection and identifying specific events causing abnormal behavior. This study addresses the LAD by transforming it from a black-box model into a white-box one, leveraging XAI to make it transparent, interpretable, explainable, and dependable. It utilizes benchmark data from the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), organized using a Drain parser, and employs several ML models, such as Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB). These models achieve impressive accuracy rates of 99.99%, 99.85%, and 99.99%, respectively. Our contribution are novel because no earlier work has been done in the area of Log Anomaly Detection (LAD) with integration of XAI-SHAP.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Kashif Alam', 'affiliation':

services consist of multiple identical cores for parallel computation to accelerate artificial neural networks. Recently, systolic array-based architectures for low-power AI accelerators have been studied to support battery-operated edge devices and reduce power consumption. In this brief, a zero-overhead method is proposed for efficient testing of systolic array-based low-power AI accelerators. By using the structural characteristics of the systolic array and a reset operation, the proposed method can test multiple identical cores based on the systolic array without any additional hardware. The proposed method is divided into MAC and comparator test methods to use the structural characteristics of systolic arrays for low-power AI accelerators. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 100% test coverage without any additional hardware and has reasonable test times compared to previous methods.', 'authors_list':

This lack of transparency may lead to these models being perceived as black boxes, potentially undermining trust in their findings among stakeholders. The primary aim of this research is to develop predictive models using diverse transfer learning techniques and shed light on the most influential factors using Shapley values. In predicting injury severity in accidents, we employ Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Residual Networks (ResNET), EfficientNetB4, InceptionV3, Extreme Inception (Xception), Visual Geometry Group (VGG19), AlexNet, and MobileNet. Among these models, MobileNet emerges with the highest accuracy at 0.9817. Furthermore, by comprehending how different features impact accident prediction models, researchers can deepen their understanding of the factors contributing to accidents and devise more effective interventions for their prevention.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Omar Aboulola', 'affiliation': 'College of Computer Science and Engineering', 'publications_count': '3', 'citations_count': '3'},

The experimental data includes mild head impacts that were replicated with median American football simulating flexion and lateral movements and was performed on ten subjects including five male and five females. OpenSim software system is used for biomechanical modeling, simulation, and analysis and to visualize the direction of the neck.

Volume: 10, Issue: 4, 15 February 2023)', 'abstract': 'Federated learning is an emerging privacy-preserving AI technique where clients (i.e., organizations or devices) train models locally and formulate a global model based on the local model updates without transferring local data externally. However, federated learning systems struggle to achieve trustworthiness and embody responsible AI principles. In particular, federated learning systems face accountability and fairness challenges due to multistakeholder involvement and heterogeneity in client data distribution. To enhance the accountability and fairness of federated learning systems, we present a blockchain-based trustworthy federated learning architecture. We first design a smart contract-based data-model provenance registry to enable accountability. Additionally, we propose a weighted fair data sampler algorithm to enhance fairness in training data. We evaluate the proposed approach using a COVID-19 X-ray detection use case. The evaluation results show that the approach is feasible to enable accountability and improve fairness. The proposed algorithm can achieve better performance than the default federated learning setting in terms of the model’s generalization and accuracy.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Sin Kit Lo',

However, there is a current deficiency in students’ AI literacy. In response to this challenge, this article introduced the AI STEM Project Design Framework (AI-STEM PDF) designed specifically for teaching AI in middle schools. The framework, created in adherence to Activity Theory and the principles of STEM environment design, consists of five layers: subject-object analysis layer, project design layer, learning tool layer, project rules layer, and project goals layer. Following the development of the AI-STEM PDF, AI-STEM projects were devised, and a pre-post experimental design study was conducted with 64 middle school students across two schools. The results revealed significant improvements in students’ AI literacy, thus affirming the value of the AI-STEM framework. Ultimately, the AI-STEM PDF has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of AI courses by providing valuable guidance for their instruction, thereby fostering the development of middle school students’ AI literacy.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Hongwu Yang', 'affiliation': 'School of Educational Technology', 'publications_count': '65', 'citations_count': '286'}, {'name': 'Di Zhang',

to be one of the most challenging life events. To help the bereaved and their therapists monitor and better understand the factors that contribute to Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), we co-designed and studied a web-based explainable AI screening system named “Grief Inquiries Following Tragedy (GIFT).” We used an initial iteration of the system to collect PGD-related data from 611 participants. Using this data, we developed a model that could be used to screen and explain the different factors contributing to PGD. Our results showed that a Random Forest model using Bereavement risk and outcome features performed best in detecting PGD (AUC=0.772), with features such as a negative intepretation of grief and the ability to integrate stressful life events contributing strongly to the model. Afterwards, five grief experts were asked to provide feedback on a mock-up of the results generated by the GIFT model, and discuss the potential value of the explanatory AI model in real-world PGD care. Overall, the grief experts were generally receptive towards using such a tool in a clinical setting and acknowledged the benefit of offering a personalized result to the users based on the explainable AI model. Our results also showed that, in addition to the explainability of the model, the grief experts also preferred a more “empathetic” and “actionable” AI system, especially, when designing for patient end-users.', 'authors_list': [{'name': 'Wan Jou She', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine', 'publications_count': '2', 'citations_count': '4'}, {'name': 'Chee Siang Ang', 'affiliation': 'School of Computing', 'publications_count': '8', 'citations_count': '110'}]}]
